# Project1-DataVis

For our project, we chose to analyze real estate data to highlight factors and considerations when choosing to buy a vacation home.

Both data sets were obtained from Kaggle with credit to Guenter Roehrich, who scraped the data from publicly available listings and created the dataset. Two datasets were used, one from California and one from Georgia. The data can be seen with the links below, or by accessing the CSV files under the dirty_data folder of the repository.

The data was then imported, cleaned, and filtered as seen in the 'California Data (cleaned)' Workbook and the 'Georgia Data (cleaned)' Workbook. The finalized cleaned data was exported as CSV files and can be accessed under the clean_data folder of the repository. These workbooks also include dataframes for the timeline of sales and listings per state. 


The 'Summary Statistics' Workbook uses both of the cleaned data sets and includes all summary tables for the data. This workbook also includes many of the dataframes and plots for comparisons between the states.

The 'Heat Maps Data' Workbook shows how the cleaned data was used to create heat maps that show the outlier homes, IQR homes, and homes with specific amenities.

All images of plots and images of heat maps can be found in the 'Images' folder.



Lastly, the 'Presentation' is the file for the ppt presentation of findings and conclusion.
